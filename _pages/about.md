I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering group at the [Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab)](https://als.lbl.gov/), advised by Dr. Jinghua Guo.

I am working on instrumentation and data analysis for high-throughput soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). This technique promises to increase the XAS data acquisition rate by a factor of ~10<sup>5</sup>, enabling the efficient exploration of thin film material libraries. I am also working to integrate electrochemical measurements with time resolved soft x-ray spectroscopy. Both efforts aim to improve our understating of functional materials used in fuel cells and sustainable fuel production.
Formerly, I worked as a postdoc for Dr. Xiaoyi Zhang at the [Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Lab)](https://www.aps.anl.gov/) developing time-resolved hard x-ray spectroscopy techniques and studying photochemical reaction mechanisms.

I am currently seeking collaborators who focus on synthesis and characterization of transition metal oxide thin films, with an emphasis on combinatorial techniques. Please feel free to reach out via **email** (eli dot kinigstein at lbl dot gov) if youâ€™d like to schedule a meeting.
